# React Native Devcontainers

A devcontainer repo for developing React Native apps in style

## Features

This repo is based on `reactnativecommunity/react-native-android` and only
adds marginal improvements, such as:

- ccache
- vim
- A colorful `.bashrc` with `vi` support
- An `.inputrc` file with `vi` mode indicator
- A lovely script file for creating .env file example for pushing to a
  public repo.

## Caveats

This container runs as root. If that's a deal breaker for you, you may need
to wait a while or look for another repo like this one.
